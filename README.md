#4. Wordpress fix
If you are using Wordpress in the root folder of your website and Documentator in a sub folder you will need to replace 3 files in your Documentator folder.

You need to replace the specified files before going trough the Installer step.

Download and unzip the Wordpress fix from GitHub and upload the contents in your Documentator folder. After you take this action you are ready to go with the installation step.

NOTE: this fix is useful for all scripts/platform that use a .htaccess file in the root.
